  "query": "When was UAE established?",
  "response": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has a presidential system, and it does not have a traditional prime minister. Instead, the UAE is led by a President who serves as both the head of state and the head of government.\nThe current President of the UAE is Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, also known as Sheikh Hazza bin Zayed Al Nahyan (although he is more commonly referred to simply as Sheikh Mohamed). He has been serving as the President since 2022.\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) was established on December 2, 1971. It was formed by seven emirates: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah, and Fujairah.\nPrior to that, the seven emirates were independent states, but they came together to form a union under the leadership of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who served as the first President of the UAE. The treaty establishing the UAE was signed on November 28, 1971, and it officially came into effect on December 2, 1971, when the seven emirates declared independence from the United Kingdom, which had been their colonial ruler since the late 19th century.",
