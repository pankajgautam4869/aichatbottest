  "query": "Who is the Prime Minister of UAE?",
  "response": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven emirates, and it does not have a single prime minister. Instead, each emirate has its own ruler or sheikh, who serves as the head of state and government.\nHowever, the UAE has a federal government that is headed by a President, who is currently Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi. The President appoints a Deputy Prime Minister, who helps to oversee the country's affairs.\nIt's worth noting that the UAE has a unique system of government, where each emirate has a significant degree of autonomy and its own ruler or sheikh. This means that the concept of a prime minister does not apply in the same way as it does in many other countries.",
