  "response": "The current Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. However, he also holds the position of Vice President and Ruler of Dubai.\nIt's worth noting that the UAE does not have a traditional prime minister in the sense of a separate head of government. Instead, the country has a Council of Ministers, which is headed by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who serves as the Prime Minister and is responsible for overseeing the country's overall governance.\nThe current Cabinet members are appointed by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and they are responsible for managing various aspects of UAE policy and administration.",
