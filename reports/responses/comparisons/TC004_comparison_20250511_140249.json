The head of state and government in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is the President, who is currently Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\nHowever, the UAE has a federal cabinet that is headed by a Prime Minister, but he is appointed by the President and is not the head of government. The current Prime Minister of Abu Dhabi, which is the capital and largest emirate of the UAE, is Sheikh Mohammad bin Zayed Al Nahyan (also known as Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi).\nIt's worth noting that the UAE has a unique system of governance, with a strong emphasis on Islamic law and a hierarchical structure.
